Here is the DFT-based dataset used to train and validate the potential in its entirety. The dataset is divided into 6 categories
  1) Base Structures: These include the OUTCARs for the intial set of 19 structures used generate the entirety of the DFT dataset
  2) Strained Structures: These include the OUTCARs of different types of strained structures (the strains being Hydrostatic, Monoclinic and Orthorhombic in nature)
  3) Li-rich structures: These include the OUTCARs of Li rich structures generated from Li3PO4 and Li7PN4 
  4) Li-poor structures: These include the OUTCARs of Li poor structures generated from Li3PO4
  5) Melt-quench structures: Due to size limitations, instead of the VASP OUTCARS the extxyz files for the generated AIMD-based melt quench structures have been provided.  
  6) Slab-based structures: These include the OUTCARs for the slabs present in the dataset
