|     The determination of the symmetry of your systems shows a strong        |
|     dependence on the tolerance parameter SYMPREC. This is often the        |
|     result of "noise" in the structural parameters (lattice vectors         |
|     and/or ionic positions). Set NWRITE=3 for more details.                 |
