|     You have a (more or less) 'small supercell' and for smaller cells       |
|     it is recommended to use the reciprocal-space projection scheme!        |
|     The real-space optimization is not efficient for small cells and it     |
|     is also less accurate ...                                               |
|     Therefore, set LREAL=.FALSE. in the INCAR file.                         |
