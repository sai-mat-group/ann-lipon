|     For optimal performance we recommend to set                             |
|       NCORE = 4 - approx SQRT(number of cores).                             |
|     NCORE specifies how many cores store one orbital (NPAR=cpu/NCORE).      |
|     This setting can greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.       |
|     The default, NCORE=1 might be grossly inefficient on modern             |
|     multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines. Do your        |
|     own testing!!!!                                                         |
|     Unfortunately you need to use the default for GW and RPA                |
|     calculations (for HF NCORE is supported but not extensively tested      |
|     yet).                                                                   |
|                                                                             |

|                                                                             |
|     You have a (more or less) 'small supercell' and for smaller cells       |
|     it is recommended to use the reciprocal-space projection scheme!        |
|     The real-space optimization is not efficient for small cells and it     |
|     is also less accurate ...                                               |
|     Therefore, set LREAL=.FALSE. in the INCAR file.                         |
|                                                                             |
